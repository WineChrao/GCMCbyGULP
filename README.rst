Utilities for performing GCMC simulation by using GULP

This package primarily provides two scripts for performing GCMC simulation of
the adsorption properties by using the GULP program.

GCMCbyGULP-gen
	Generates the input files and directories for GCMC simulation by GULP.

GCMCbyGULP-read
	Reads the results for GCMC simulations after the simulation has finished.
